# Update Command Builder

The command performs an update using the provided model. 

## Arguments

The parameter object must contain the primary key(s) necessary to locate the record. The keys are normally read from the database, but you can override this behavior to use properties on the object that use the Key attribute.

The remaining properties on the parameter object are used to construct the UPDATE statment. If a property is marked with the IgnoreOnUpdate attribute, it will not participate in this step. This attribute is usually applied to columns that should never be changed such as CretedBy/CreatedDate.

If you use the ChangedPropertiesOnly option, only properties marked as changed by `IPropertyChangeTracking.ChangedProperties()` will be used. This interface is found in the `Tortuga.Anchor.ComponentModel` namespace.

Alternately, a parameter dictionary of type `IReadonlyDictionary<string, object>` may be used. Again, the primary keys will be read from database metadata.

## SQL Generation

If the materializer desires columns, this echos back the inserted/updated row. 

## Limitations

This command is meant to operate on one row at a time. Set-based operations need to be performed using a SQL or Procedure command.

## Internals

Implementation of the delete varies by database.

### SQL Server

SQL Server uses an UPDATE statement with an optional OUTPUT clause.

### SQLite

SQLite uses a separate UPDATE and optional SELECT statement.
